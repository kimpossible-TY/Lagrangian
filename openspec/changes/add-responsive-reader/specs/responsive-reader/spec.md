## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Parallel reading outputs
The system SHALL produce a reflowable HTML reading view from the same saved Typst source as the existing paged view. Existing PDF export and the running paged endpoint SHALL remain available.

#### Scenario: Mobile entry
- **WHEN** a phone opens the configured reading entry after rollout
- **THEN** it receives the responsive reader and can explicitly open the original paged view
- **AND** the user's explicit view preference is respected

### Requirement: Mathematical fidelity
The reader MUST retain mathematical symbols and decorations, equation and theorem numbers, cross references, footnotes, and annotation meaning. Unsupported constructs MUST use faithful alternative rendering or produce a visible diagnostic, never silently disappear.

#### Scenario: PDE annotations
- **WHEN** a document contains mannot or scoped mathematical annotations
- **THEN** marked terms remain associated with their annotation content after reflow

#### Scenario: Decoration after a mathematical line break
- **WHEN** a marked term occupies multiple visual fragments
- **THEN** its semantic mathematical content remains available independently of its decoration
- **AND** the original decoration is rendered against every fragment without painting the inter-line gap
- **AND** obsolete geometry cannot paint the new document or retain a misleading decoration after a font change

#### Scenario: Native cancellation and overline
- **WHEN** a source equation contains a cancellation or overline
- **THEN** its mathematical body remains semantic, selectable text
- **AND** cancellation paint retains the resolved source stroke, angle, length, inversion, and cross settings on every measured fragment
- **AND** assistive mathematics retains the cancellation notation after visual line breaking
- **AND** an overline visibly spans its complete mathematical body
- **AND** the paged output is unchanged

#### Scenario: A graphical relationship targets a wrapped term
- **WHEN** one logical marked term occupies several visual fragments
- **THEN** the relationship request retains every fragment rectangle and the original logical target identity
- **AND** named and angular anchors resolve to actual fragment surfaces, not an empty inter-line bounding rectangle
- **AND** the original CeTZ callback and its literal coordinate origin are preserved without editing authored figure positions

#### Scenario: A supported connection crosses readable text
- **WHEN** an open line or Bezier connection between named marked terms crosses the measured mathematical text
- **THEN** the reader may recompose its path around text without changing its target anchors, styling, or arrowhead definitions
- **AND** the route is validated for the current revision and geometry, with vertical space reserved for any outsets
- **AND** an unsupported or unsuccessful route remains an explicit layout failure

### Requirement: Responsive readable content
The reader SHALL lay out ordinary text, mathematical expressions, figures, and essential annotations at 320–768 CSS px and the user's selected font size in the continuous reading body. Reading this content MUST NOT require zooming, horizontal panning, a slide/carousel, opening a separate equation view, or clicking to reveal essential content. Shrinking a complete equation or canvas until its labels become unreadable MUST NOT count as responsive layout.

#### Scenario: Asynchronous mathematical composition
- **WHEN** a mathematical expression is recomposed for a new width or reading font
- **THEN** the reader validates its logical tokens before replacing the current expression
- **AND** results from an obsolete document, removed section, or obsolete measurement cannot publish
- **AND** publication waits for an active text selection or reader dialog to end
- **AND** a failed composition preserves the current expression, reports the failure, and retries automatically

#### Scenario: Directory metadata changes without a saved-source edit
- **WHEN** known input directory timestamps or Finder metadata change while the compiler inputs and entry names remain the same
- **THEN** the accepted snapshot remains valid for dynamic rendering
- **AND** creation of a previously missing import is still detected

#### Scenario: Local mathematical assets and semantic reading
- **WHEN** the reader composes mathematical content
- **THEN** its renderer and fonts load from the Reader origin without a third-party CDN
- **AND** copied text retains canonical source order without assistive-content duplicates
- **AND** semantic math and keyboard-accessible references remain available to assistive technology

#### Scenario: A long equation or wide drawing
- **WHEN** an equation, matrix, or drawing exceeds the available width at readable text size
- **THEN** the layout stage uses mathematically valid line breaks, alignment changes, or an explicit faithful alternate composition
- **AND** figure panels, labels, and legends are recomposed rather than uniformly shrinking their text
- **AND** unresolved layout is a failed release requirement; clipping, scrolling, and expansion controls do not satisfy it

#### Scenario: A wide inline expression
- **WHEN** an inline expression cannot fit its reading container at the chosen font size
- **THEN** it may recompose into a block within the continuous body without a user action
- **AND** its inline mathematical style, fraction sizing, limits, and logical text remain unchanged
- **AND** short inline expressions keep their original presentation

#### Scenario: A wide structured mathematical body
- **WHEN** a fraction, radical, spanning decoration, scripted base, or matrix exceeds the reading width
- **THEN** the reader may compose its children at a measured inner width while retaining their mathematical grouping, script levels, labels, and canonical text
- **AND** matrix rows and columns remain intact and entry fonts retain the selected reading size
- **AND** short norms and intervals remain on one line when they fit
- **AND** a stretched operator remains completely visible, without scroll area from its masked stencil pieces

#### Scenario: Continuous reading
- **WHEN** a reader reaches a section boundary or a mathematical annotation
- **THEN** the next content is available through ordinary vertical reading without a required next-section button or reveal action
- **AND** storage or lazy loading boundaries are not presented as slides

#### Scenario: Font or orientation change
- **WHEN** a reader enlarges text or rotates the device
- **THEN** paragraphs reflow, labels remain readable, and the same logical passage stays in view

### Requirement: Revision-aware updates
The reader SHALL expose the compiled revision and compilation state, retain the last successful output on compilation failure, and preserve reading anchors and selections across updates.

#### Scenario: Failed source edit
- **WHEN** a saved edit fails to compile
- **THEN** the last valid document remains usable with an explicit stale/error status
- **AND** a successful subsequent compilation updates the reader without losing its logical reading position

### Requirement: Persistent local highlights
The reader SHALL save explicitly selected quotations in browser-local storage scoped to the current document, including context for relocation after edits. It SHALL preserve the original quotation when relocation is uncertain or impossible.

#### Scenario: Paragraph or section moves
- **WHEN** a saved quotation remains present after surrounding text or section boundaries change
- **THEN** the reader locates it in the accepted revision and can navigate to its current section
- **AND** rendering the highlight does not insert HTML elements into MathML

#### Scenario: Ambiguous or removed quotation
- **WHEN** no unique current location can be established
- **THEN** the saved quotation remains visible with its missing or ambiguous status
- **AND** the reader does not guess a location or silently remove the saved record

#### Scenario: Mathematical presentation order changes
- **WHEN** line breaking or script layout changes the presentation DOM order
- **THEN** saved quotations retain the source's logical character order
- **AND** highlighting a base and its subscript does not also highlight an unselected superscript
- **AND** repeated visual occurrences retain their association with the same logical token

### Requirement: Independent serving boundary
Flow SHALL own reader compilation and project settings. Tail Hosting SHALL expose and monitor the reader endpoint without taking ownership of document rendering or duplicating the service lifecycle.

#### Scenario: Independent Reader lifecycle
- **WHEN** the Reader is started, stopped, restarted, or recovered after an unexpected exit
- **THEN** only its own managed process and LaunchAgent are affected
- **AND** the original paged service remains available
- **AND** a new Reader start resolves the current parent Flow project settings

#### Scenario: Compile monitoring
- **WHEN** Tail Hosting checks the Reader
- **THEN** it distinguishes HTTP reachability from the Reader's reported compile and content-validation result
- **AND** serving the last accepted revision after a failed save is reported as a compile failure
